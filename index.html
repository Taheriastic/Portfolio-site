                <div class="about-text">
                    <p>I'm Taher Chandiwala from India, currently a Junior studying Computer Science & Artificial Intelligence and Strategic Finance at Minerva University in San Francisco. At one of the world's most selective universities (1.5% acceptance rate), I'm passionate about using technology and strategic finance to create positive global impact through consulting and innovation.</p>
                    
                    <p>Through Minerva's unique rotational program, I've had the incredible opportunity to live, work, and study across multiple continents, developing expertise in business consulting and financial strategy. So far, I've gained invaluable experiences in the USA, Taiwan, South Korea, Japan, and India, each location teaching me new perspectives on innovation, culture, and strategic problem-solving.</p>
                    
                    <p>Looking ahead, I'm excited to spend my next two years exploring and learning in Buenos Aires (Argentina), Tokyo (Japan), Berlin (Germany), and San Francisco (USA). This global education approach has shaped my worldview and enhanced my ability to provide strategic consulting across diverse cultural and professional environments.</p>
